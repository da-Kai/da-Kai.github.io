I just published my github repository for *[DartDart](https://github.com/da-Kai/DartDart)*, a Dart-Scoreboard app for Web, Desktop and Mobile.

The App is built using *[flutter](https://flutter.dev/)* and *[dart](https://dart.dev/)* and is intended to be a simple, modern, ad-free.
DartDart alows you to keep track of your dart games.

*[DartDart](https://github.com/da-Kai/DartDart)* released as a Prototype preview which can be testest online on [da-kai.github.io/DartDart](https://da-kai.github.io/DartDart/) or downloaded as [dart-dart.apk](https://github.com/da-Kai/DartDart/releases/download/prototype/dart-dart.apk) for android.
