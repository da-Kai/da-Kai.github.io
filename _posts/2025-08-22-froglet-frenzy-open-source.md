# Froglet Frenzy - From GameJam to OpenSource

<img src="/assets/img/froglet_frenzy_banner.png" style="margin: 10pt;" >

## Announcement 

### Project Information 

"Froglet Frenzy" was created as my submission for [VimJam 5](https://itch.io/jam/vimjam5) on itch.io. The jam ran from November 8th, 2024 to November 18th, 2024. The Jam Focus was **Racing** and the Theme was **ESCAPE**.

Even though it was my first jam and my very first game made and released using Godot, I also decided to adhere to all Challenges/Diversifiers, which were:
- **4 Color Palette**: Use a maximum of four colors throughout the game
- **Animal Characters**: No human characters! Only animals (or anthropomorphic creatures)
- **Mouse Only**: The game can be controlled entirely with the mouse

The whole process was quite an adventure. While I have some coding background, I had zero experience in pixel art or music. Somehow I managed to piece it all together into a playable game.

Seeing my game later in the [Best Game From VimJam 5 - Game Jam Showcase](https://youtu.be/8mtmF4VPo8o?t=625) YouTube video was very exciting ðŸ˜Š.

### Open Source Release ðŸš€

I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve open-sourced the code for this game.
I hope this helps anyone looking into creating games using Godot 4.x.

You can now check out the full project on GitHub:

For anyone thinking about picking up Godot for their first jam game, feel free to browse through my repository and use the code however you like.

Just keep in mind that since this was my very first project, it's definitely far from perfect, but maybe itâ€™ll be useful or inspiring for someone starting out.
